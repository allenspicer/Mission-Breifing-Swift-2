# Mission-Breifing-Swift-2

This app is the result of a challenge - born of an assignment at TIY. The discussion was whether it's possible to use the emoji functionality of Swift to actually build an app. 

The answer was clearly yes - it's possible. In fact I put it on one line. Is it necessary (or helpful)? No, not really.
